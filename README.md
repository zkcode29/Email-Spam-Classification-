#  Email Spam Classification - NLP & Machine Learning Project

A complete machine learning pipeline to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham** using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms.


---

##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate machine learning model to classify email messages as either **legitimate ("Ham")** or **unsolicited ("Spam")**. This involves:

- Cleaning and preprocessing raw text data
- Extracting meaningful features
- Building and tuning multiple machine learning models
- Evaluating and visualizing model performance

---

##  Key Features

-  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
-  **Text Cleaning & Preprocessing (NLTK)**
-  **Feature Engineering**
-  **Machine Learning Pipelines**
-  **GridSearchCV for Hyperparameter Tuning**
-  **Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix**
-  **Visualizations: ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix Heatmap**
