#  Email Spam Classification - NLP & Machine Learning Project

A complete machine learning pipeline to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham** using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms.

>  This project was built during **Data Science Week 03** of the **Digital Empowerment Network** program under the mentorship of **Ali Mohiuddin Khan**.

##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate machine learning model to classify email messages as either **legitimate ("Ham")** or **unsolicited ("Spam")**. This involves:

- Cleaning and preprocessing raw text data
- Extracting meaningful features
- Building and tuning multiple machine learning models
- Evaluating and visualizing model performance
